# Shinkansen Bullet Train Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting passenger satisfaction for the Shinkansen Bullet Train using machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether passengers were satisfied (`1`) or not satisfied (`0`) based on travel and survey data.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to identify which parameters play an important role in influencing passenger satisfaction (`Overall_Experience`). The objective is to build a machine learning model using the training data to predict satisfaction levels in the test data.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of two main parts:

1. **Travel Data**: Information related to passengers and attributes of the Shinkansen train.
2. **Survey Data**: Post-service feedback collected from passengers, including the target variable (`Overall_Experience`).

### Target Variable
- `Overall_Experience`: Binary variable indicating passenger satisfaction (1 = satisfied, 0 = not satisfied).

### Files Provided
- **Train Data**: Training data with labels (`Overall_Experience`).
  - `Traveldata_train.csv`
  - `Surveydata_train.csv`
  
- **Test Data**: Test data without labels for prediction.
  - `Traveldata_test.csv`
  - `Surveydata_test.csv`
  
- **Data Dictionary**: Provides explanations for features and survey levels.

## Goal
The goal is to predict whether a passenger was satisfied (`1`) or not satisfied (`0`) using the provided features and datasets. The final submission should include predictions for 35,602 test data points.
